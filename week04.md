# Week 4

OMG, I have a information overload. I've been confused and frustrated all week. It felt like I could not get anything right, and on top of that, my mind would not find any solutions to any examples our instructor gave us. Thank GOD this week is over. I can reset and start fresh. I'll be ready.
