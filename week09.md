# Week 9
## "Which topic would you find the most interesting to develop an app around?"

Personally, for me I love to watch movies, so developing an app around movies would be dope. I am quite sure they have an app like this already but how I would develop it would be a bit different. My movie will have all movie trailers to be view before you watch the movie. I may also add reviews on how the movies are by real movie watchers. It will be dope.
