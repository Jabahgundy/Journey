# Week 5
## "Finishing up Javascript"
This week I have learned a lot. I am getting comfortable. In the beginning, I was getting a bit frustrated, now I take a lot of notes in my note pad. It is my way of keeping up and referencing what I will need later in my career. On the other hand, our instructor, Sean is a great teacher and I ask him plenty of questions when permitted, because next week, we have another project to complete, and I want to be fully prepared. I am nervous of course, however, I can do this. I have faith in myself I believe weâ€™ll be just fine.
