# Week 3
## "CSS and HTML"

This week very challenging, but I pulled through. I am very eager to learn more about building websites and designing them as well. My dream is to become the best at what I do but in order to get there, I must be patient with myself. I have to put aside the knowledge I do know and create space for something new. I'm glad I'm here learning code, just taking this experience one day at a time.
