# Week 6
## "FrontEnd Project"
Project week. I felt a bit nervous in the beginning but thanks to my team, they’ve help me overcome my fears of working with JavaScript and API’s. My biggest accomplishments were making the “meet the team” page without using any additions like bootstrap or stack overflow. I am noticeably confident using HTML and CSS program languages, JavaScript on the other hand, a different story. Again, thanks to my team. We completed our projects and it has turned out great.
