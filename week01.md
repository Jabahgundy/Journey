# Week 1
## "The Beginning of my Journey to Coding"

Week 1 was difficult, however, I made it through. I learned a lot and I want to learn more. At the beginning in day one, I was afraid. I wanted to quite at times, I just had to sit back and relax, and read the material. I also started practicing on my own and then it began to click for me. Well, week one is done and now fifteen weeks to go. Hopefully, I do well.
