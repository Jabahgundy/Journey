# Week 2
## "Project Week"
This week has been much better. Python continue to have its’ challenges; however, I have gotten better conceptualizing different methods of this program language. I could not say the same during the first week of class, I wanted to throw in the towel. I let the fear of not knowing impede on the process of learning. Comparatively, if you ask me that same question now; I would simply say “I am just enjoying the journey”. This week, we are completing our first group projects, and I am knowing we all will do great.
